# Schyntax Changelog

Schyntax uses a simple versioning scheme where non-breaking changes, unless very substantial, are indicated with a patch number. Breaking changes which are unlikely to affect many, if any, users are indicated with a minor version. And changes which will break backwards compatibility for many users will be considered a major version.

Schyntax implementations should indicate which version of the spec they currently implement.
