# Schyntax

Schyntax is a domain-specific language for defining event schedules in a terse, but more readable format than cron.

This project will hold the formal language specification, documentation, and an official test suite. The reference implementation is [js-schyntax](https://github.com/schyntax/js-schyntax).

At this point the language and reference implementation is in an alpha state with defined roadmap items. If you're interested in contributing to the specification, an implementation, or writing your own implementation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/schyntax/schyntax/issues) on this project.
